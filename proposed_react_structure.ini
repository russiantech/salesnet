Setting up a professional and scalable React project structure for a large eCommerce platform involves careful planning and organization. 
Here's Suggested project structure that incorporates the various features I mentioned, along with best practices for scalability and maintainability.

`Setting up a professional and scalable 
react project structure to biggest ecommerce platform, 
with chat, posts, comments, sales, cart, wish-lists, ordering, payment, 
recommendations, search and search histories, 
discounting, returns, geo-locations etc. Be very professional.

Key Things here:

1. Feature-Based Organization: Group components and features by functionality to improve maintainability and scalability.
  
2. Custom Hooks: Use hooks to encapsulate logic that can be reused across components, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

3. Context API: Utilize the Context API for managing global state, especially for authentication, cart, and user preferences.

4. API Services: Create a dedicated folder for API services to handle all network requests, improving separation of concerns.

5. Styling: Consider using CSS modules or styled-components for scoped styles, reducing the risk of style conflicts.

6. Environment Variables: Use a `.env` file to manage sensitive information and configuration settings.

7. Testing: Integrate testing frameworks (like Jest and React Testing Library) to ensure code quality and reliability.

8. Documentation: Maintain a `README.md` file for project setup, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines.

By following this structure and these considerations, our React project will be well-equipped to handle the complexities of a large eCommerce platform while remaining scalable and maintainable.

Assets in the `public` directory VS Putting it in the `src` directory of a React project

`public/` Directory

Pros:
1. Static Serving:
   - Assets in the `public` directory are served directly by the web server. They can be accessed via a straightforward URL without any build processing.

2. Simplicity:
   - Ideal for files that don’t need to be processed by Webpack (like favicons, manifest files, etc.).

3. SEO and Performance:
   - Static assets can be cached by browsers, improving load times and SEO.

4. Direct Access:
   - You can reference assets directly in your HTML or JavaScript without needing to import them.

Cons:
1. No Processing:
   - Files in `public` are not processed by Webpack, which means you won't benefit from features like image optimization, bundling, or tree-shaking.

2. Less Control:
   - You have less control over how these assets are included in your build process.

`src/` Directory

Pros:
1. Build Processing:
   - Files in the `src` directory are processed by Webpack, allowing for features like image optimization, bundling, and support for CSS preprocessors.

2. Module Imports:
   - You can import assets directly into your components, which can help with code organization and maintainability.

3. Dynamic Imports:
   - Supports dynamic imports, which can be useful for lazy-loading images or other assets.

Cons:
1. Build Complexity:
   - Assets must be imported, which can add complexity to your code.

2. Access Path:
   - You need to use import statements to access assets, which can be less intuitive for static files.

When to Use Each

- Use `public/` for:
  - Favicons, manifest files, and other static assets that need to be directly accessible.
  - Assets that do not require processing or optimization.
  - Large files or assets that you want to serve directly without going through the build process.

- Use `src/` for:
  - Images, fonts, and other assets that will be used within components and can benefit from Webpack processing.
  - Assets that need to be imported dynamically or require optimization.
  - Assets that are tightly coupled to your application logic and should be treated as modules.

Conclusion

In general, for most assets that are used within the React components and can benefit from Webpack's processing, the `src` directory is the better choice. 
For static files that need to be served directly or don’t require processing, the `public` directory is appropriate.
